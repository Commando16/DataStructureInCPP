INfix to POSTfix conversion - 


Rule for converson

1. print operands as they arrive.


2. if stack is empty or contains a left paranthiesis on top, PUSH the incoming operator onto the stack.


3. if incoming symbol is "(", PUSH it onto stack.


4. if incoming symbol is ")", PUSH it onto stack & print the operators until left
paranthesis is found.


5. if incoming symbol has HIGHRER precedence then the top of the symbol has higher precedence than the top of the stack, PUSH it on the stack.


6. if incoming symbol has LOWER precedence then the top of the stack, POP ans print the top. Then test the incoming operator with the new top of the stack.


7. if incoming operatior has equal precedence with the top of the stack, use associativity rule.

	- if associativity LEFT to RIGHT then POP and print the top of the stack and then PUSH the incomming operator.

	- if RIGHT to LEFT then PUSH the incoming operator. 


8. At the end of the expression, POP and print all operator  of stack.








# PRECEDENCE AND ASSOCIATIVITY OF THE OPERATOR

	^		(right to left)
	* / 	(left to right)
	+ -		(left to right)
