Graph traversal techniques:-

# BFS(Breadth First Search) - 
	-BFS is a vertex based technique for finding a shortest path in graph.
	
	-It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. 

	-In BFS, one vertex is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and stored in the queue.

	-It is slower than DFS.

	-Time complexity is O(V + E) when Adjacency List is used and O(V^2) when Adjacency Matrix is used, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.

	-It is also known as Level Order Treversal.

# DFS(Depth First Search) -
	-DFS is a edge based technique. 

	-It uses a Stack data structure which follows first in last out. 

	-It uses the Stack data structure, performs two stages, first visited vertices are pushed into stack and second if there is no vertices then visited vertices are popped.

	-Time complexity is also O(V + E) when Adjacency List is used and O(V^2) when Adjacency Matrix is used, where V stands for vertices and E stands for edges.
