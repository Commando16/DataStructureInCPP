Types of edges in DFS Traversal:-

# Tree edge - 
				It is an edge which is present in the tree obtained after applying DFS on the graph.

# Forward edges - 
					The edges which are not the part of DFS traversal. 

					Let's say e:(x,y) where y appears after x and there is u path from x to y.

# Back edges -  
				The edges which are not the part of DFS traversal. 

				Let's say e:(x,y) where y appears before x and there is a path from y to x.

				Presence of back edge indicates a cycle in directed graph. 

# Cross edges - 
				The edges which are not the part of DFS traversal. 

				Let's say e:(x,y) where no path from y to x.


where x -----> y
