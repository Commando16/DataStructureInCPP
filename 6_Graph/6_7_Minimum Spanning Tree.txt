Minimum Spanning Tree:-

#Spanning Tree - 
				Let's G(V,E) be a graph and there is a spanning tree i.e G'(V',E')
				where, V' = V and E' is subset of E and E' = |V|-1.

				Spanning tree should not contain any cycle.
				Spanning tree should not be disconnected.

#Properties of Spanning Tree - 
				
				- Removing one edge from the spanning tree will make it disconnected.

				- Adding one edge to the spanning tree will create a loop.

				- If each edge has distint weight then there will be only one and unique Minimum Spanning Tree.

				- A complete indirected graph(each vartex connected with one another) can have n^n-2(n is number of vartices) numbers of spanning tree.

				- Every connected and undirected graph has atleast on spanning tree.

				- Disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree.

				- From a complete graph by removing max(e-n+1) edges we can construct a spanning tree.
