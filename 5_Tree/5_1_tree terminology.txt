Tree-
	- Tree is a non-linear data strcture.
	- Tree simulate heirarchy.


Tree terminologies -

root - 
	  the top most element of the tree. It dont have any parent.


node - 
	  nodes are the container which store data and links to other nodes.


parent/ parent node - 
	  the node which have atleast one node connected below it is called parent node.


child/ child node - 
	  the node having atleast one ancistor.

leaf node - 
	  the node having no child.

non leaf node - 
	  the node having atleast one child.

path - 
	  sequence of consecutive edges from source node to destination node.

edge - 
	  link between parent and child node.

sibling - 
	  the child node having same parent.


sub-tree - 
	  WRITE DEFINATION HERE.


Degree - 
	  number of direct child nodes a node have is called a degree.


Degree of tree - 
	   the maximum degree of any node in a tree is called the degree of that tree.


Depth of a node - 
	  the number of edges form root to that node is called deoth of that node.


height - 
	  the number of edges it require to reach it deepest leaf node.


level of tree -
	  the height of the root is called level of tree.
